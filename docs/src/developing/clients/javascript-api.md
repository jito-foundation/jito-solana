## What is Solana-Web3.js?

The Solana-Web3.js library aims to provide complete coverage of Solana. The library was built on top of the [Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api).

You can find the full documentation for the `@solana/web3.js` library [here](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/).

## Common Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Program     | Stateless executable code written to interpret instructions. Programs are capable of performing actions based on the instructions provided. |
| Instruction | The smallest unit of a program that a client can include in a transaction. Within its processing code, an instruction may contain one or more cross-program invocations. |
| Transaction | One or more instructions signed by the client using one or more Keypairs and executed atomically with only two possible outcomes: success or failure. |

## Quickstart

### Connecting to a Wallet

To allow users to use your dApp or application on Solana, they will need to get access to their Keypair. A Keypair is a private key with a matching public key, used to sign transactions.

There are two ways to obtain a Keypair:
1. Generate a new Keypair
2. Obtain a Keypair using the secret key

You can obtain a new Keypair with the following:

```javascript
const {Keypair} = require("@solana/web3.js");

let keypair = Keypair.generate();
```

This will generate a brand new Keypair for a user to fund and use within your application.

You can allow entry of the secretKey using a textbox, and obtain the Keypair with `Keypair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)`.

```javascript
const {Keypair} = require("@solana/web3.js");

let secretKey = Uint8Array.from([
  202, 171, 192, 129, 150, 189, 204, 241, 142,  71, 205,
  2,  81,  97,   2, 176,  48,  81,  45,   1,  96, 138,
  220, 132, 231, 131, 120,  77,  66,  40,  97, 172,  91,
  245,  84, 221, 157, 190,   9, 145, 176, 130,  25,  43,
  72, 107, 190, 229,  75,  88, 191, 136,   7, 167, 109,
  91, 170, 164, 186,  15, 142,  36,  12,  23
]);

let keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(secretKey);
```

Many wallets today allow users to bring their Keypair using a variety of extensions or web wallets. The general recommendation is to use wallets, not Keypairs, to sign transactions. The wallet creates a layer of separation between the dApp and the Keypair, ensuring that the dApp never has access to the secret key. You can find ways to connect to external wallets with the [wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) library.

### Creating and Sending Transactions

To interact with programs on Solana, you create, sign, and send transactions to the network. Transactions are collections of instructions with signatures. The order that instructions exist in a transaction determines the order they are executed.

A transaction in Solana-Web3.js is created using the [`Transaction`](javascript-api.md#Transaction) object and adding desired messages, addresses, or instructions.

Take the example of a transfer transaction:

```javascript
const {Keypair, Transaction, SystemProgram, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} = require("@solana/web3.js");

let fromKeypair = Keypair.generate();
let toKeypair = Keypair.generate();
let transaction = new Transaction();

transaction.add(
  SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: fromKeypair.publicKey,
    toPubkey: toKeypair.publicKey,
    lamports: LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
  })
);
```

The above code achieves creating a transaction ready to be signed and broadcasted to the network. The `SystemProgram.transfer` instruction was added to the transaction, containing the amount of lamports to send, and the `to` and `from` public keys.

All that is left is to sign the transaction with keypair and send it over the network. You can accomplish sending a transaction by using `sendAndConfirmTransaction` if you wish to alert the user or do something after a transaction is finished, or use `sendTransaction` if you don't need to wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

```javascript
const {sendAndConfirmTransaction, clusterApiUrl, Connection} = require("@solana/web3.js");

let keypair = Keypair.generate();
let connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('testnet'));

sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [keypair]
);
```

The above code takes in a `TransactionInstruction` using `SystemProgram`, creates a `Transaction`, and sends it over the network. You use `Connection` in order to define which Solana network you are connecting to, namely `mainnet-beta`, `testnet`, or `devnet`.

### Interacting with Custom Programs

The previous section visits sending basic transactions. In Solana everything you do interacts with different programs, including the previous section's transfer transaction. At the time of writing programs on Solana are either written in Rust or C.

Let's look at the `SystemProgram`. The method signature for allocating space in your account on Solana in Rust looks like this:

```rust
pub fn allocate(
    pubkey: &Pubkey,
    space: u64
) -> Instruction
```

In Solana when you want to interact with a program you must first know all the accounts you will be interacting with.

You must always provide every account that the program will be interacting within the instruction. Not only that, but you must provide whether or not the account is `isSigner` or `isWritable`.

In the `allocate` method above, a single account `pubkey` is required, as well as an amount of `space` for allocation. We know that the `allocate` method writes to the account by allocating space within it, making the `pubkey` required to be `isWritable`. `isSigner` is required when you are designating the account that is running the instruction. In this case, the signer is the account calling to allocate space within itself.

Let's look at how to call this instruction using solana-web3.js:

```javascript
let keypair = web3.Keypair.generate();
let payer = web3.Keypair.generate();
let connection = new web3.Connection(web3.clusterApiUrl('testnet'));

let airdropSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
  payer.publicKey,
  web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
);

await connection.confirmTransaction(airdropSignature);
```

First, we set up the account Keypair and connection so that we have an account to make allocate on the testnet. We also create a payer Keypair and airdrop some sol so we can pay for the allocate transaction.

```javascript
let allocateTransaction = new web3.Transaction({
    feePayer: payer.publicKey
  });
let keys = [{pubkey: keypair.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true}];
let params = { space: 100 };
```

We create the transaction `allocateTransaction`, keys, and params objects. `feePayer` is an optional field when creating a transaction that specifies who is paying for the transaction, defaulting to the pubkey of the first signer in the transaction. `keys` represents all accounts that the program's `allocate` function will interact with. Since the `allocate` function also required space, we created `params` to be used later when invoking the `allocate` function.

```javascript
let allocateStruct = {
  index: 8,
  layout: struct([
    u32('instruction'),
    ns64('space'),
  ])
};
```

The above is created using `u32` and `ns64` from `@solana/buffer-layout` to facilitate the payload creation. The `allocate` function takes in the parameter `space`. To interact with the function we must provide the data as a Buffer format. The `buffer-layout` library helps with allocating the buffer and encoding it correctly for Rust programs on Solana to interpret.

Let's break down this struct.

```javascript
{
  index: 8, /* <-- */
  layout: struct([
    u32('instruction'),
    ns64('space'),
  ])
}
```

`index` is set to 8 because the function `allocate` is in the 8th position in the instruction enum for `SystemProgram`.

```rust
/* https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/21bc43ed58c63c827ba4db30426965ef3e807180/sdk/program/src/system_instruction.rs#L142-L305 */
pub enum SystemInstruction {
    /** 0 **/CreateAccount {/**/},
    /** 1 **/Assign {/**/},
    /** 2 **/Transfer {/**/},
    /** 3 **/CreateAccountWithSeed {/**/},
    /** 4 **/AdvanceNonceAccount,
    /** 5 **/WithdrawNonceAccount(u64),
    /** 6 **/InitializeNonceAccount(Pubkey),
    /** 7 **/AuthorizeNonceAccount(Pubkey),
    /** 8 **/Allocate {/**/},
    /** 9 **/AllocateWithSeed {/**/},
    /** 10 **/AssignWithSeed {/**/},
    /** 11 **/TransferWithSeed {/**/},
}
```

Next up is `u32('instruction')`.

```javascript
{
  index: 8,
  layout: struct([
    u32('instruction'), /* <-- */
    ns64('space'),
  ])
}
```

The `layout` in the allocate struct must always have `u32('instruction')` first when you are using it to call an instruction.

```javascript
{
  index: 8,
  layout: struct([
    u32('instruction'),
    ns64('space'), /* <-- */
  ])
}
```

`ns64('space')` is the argument for the `allocate` function. You can see in the original `allocate` function in Rust that space was of the type `u64`. `u64` is an unsigned 64bit integer. Javascript by default only provides up to 53bit integers. `ns64` comes from `@solana/buffer-layout` to help with type conversions between Rust and Javascript. You can find more type conversions between Rust and Javascript at [solana-labs/buffer-layout](https://github.com/solana-labs/buffer-layout).

```javascript
let data = Buffer.alloc(allocateStruct.layout.span);
let layoutFields = Object.assign({instruction: allocateStruct.index}, params);
allocateStruct.layout.encode(layoutFields, data);
```

Using the previously created bufferLayout, we can allocate a data buffer. We then assign our params `{ space: 100 }` so that it maps correctly to the layout, and encode it to the data buffer. Now the data is ready to be sent to the program.

```javascript
allocateTransaction.add(new web3.TransactionInstruction({
  keys,
  programId: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
  data,
}));

await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, allocateTransaction, [payer, keypair]);
```

Finally, we add the transaction instruction with all the account keys, payer, data, and programId and broadcast the transaction to the network.

The full code can be found below.

```javascript
const {struct, u32, ns64} = require("@solana/buffer-layout");
const {Buffer} = require('buffer');
const web3 = require("@solana/web3.js");

let keypair = web3.Keypair.generate();
let payer = web3.Keypair.generate();

let connection = new web3.Connection(web3.clusterApiUrl('testnet'));

let airdropSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
  payer.publicKey,
  web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
);

await connection.confirmTransaction(airdropSignature);

let allocateTransaction = new web3.Transaction({
  feePayer: payer.publicKey
});
let keys = [{pubkey: keypair.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true}];
let params = { space: 100 };

let allocateStruct = {
  index: 8,
  layout: struct([
    u32('instruction'),
    ns64('space'),
  ])
};

let data = Buffer.alloc(allocateStruct.layout.span);
let layoutFields = Object.assign({instruction: allocateStruct.index}, params);
allocateStruct.layout.encode(layoutFields, data);

allocateTransaction.add(new web3.TransactionInstruction({
  keys,
  programId: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
  data,
}));

await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, allocateTransaction, [payer, keypair]);
```
