These architectural proposals have been accepted by the Solana maintainers, but are not yet fully implemented. These proposals may be implemented as described, implemented differently as issues in the designs become evident, or not implemented at all.

## After Implemented

Once a proposal has been implemented, it will be moved to [Implemented Proposals](../implemented-proposals/implemented-proposals.md) and the details will be added to relevant sections of the docs.

## Submit a New Proposal

To submit a new design proposal, consult this guide on [how to submit a design proposal](../proposals.md#submit-a-design-proposal).
