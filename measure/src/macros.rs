/// Use `measure!()` when you have an expression that you want to measure.  `measure!()` will start

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// // Measure functions
/// # use solana_measure::measure;
/// # fn foo() {}
/// # fn bar(x: i32) {}
/// # fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {x + y}
/// let (result, measure) = measure!(foo(), "foo takes no parameters");
/// let (result, measure) = measure!(bar(42), "bar takes one parameter");
/// let (result, measure) = measure!(add(1, 2), "add takes two parameters and returns a value");
/// # assert_eq!(result, 1 + 2);
/// ```

/// ```
/// // Measure methods
/// # use solana_measure::measure;
/// # struct Foo {
