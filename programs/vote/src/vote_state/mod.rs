//    we must guarantee `s.confirmations <= s'.confirmations`

// { slot 0, confirmations: 31 }
// { slot 1, confirmations: 30 }
//
// is a legal tower that could be submitted on top of a previously empty tower. However,
// there is no way to create this tower from the iterative process, because slot 1 would
// have to have at least one other slot on top of it, even if the first 30 votes were all
// popped off.
