//    a) If there exists an `s'` in `new_state` where `s.slot == s'.slot`, then
//    we must guarantee `s.confirmations <= s'.confirmations`
//
//    b) If there does not exist any such `s'` in `new_state`, then there exists
//    some `t` that is the smallest vote in `new_state` where `t.slot > s.slot`.
//    `t` must have expired/popped off s', so it must be guaranteed that
//    `s.last_locked_out_slot() < t`.

// is a vote state that could have been created by iteratively building a tower
// by processing one vote at a time. For instance, the tower:
//
// { slot 0, confirmations: 31 }
// { slot 1, confirmations: 30 }
//
// is a legal tower that could be submitted on top of a previously empty tower. However,
// there is no way to create this tower from the iterative process, because slot 1 would
// have to have at least one other slot on top of it, even if the first 30 votes were all
// popped off.
