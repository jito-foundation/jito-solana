/// A guest-side representation of a slice of memory.

/// `VmSlice` serves as a stable layout for memory shared between the guest and the host.
/// It is also the layout for `SolSignerSeedC` and `SolSignerSeedsC`. `VmSlice` is used anytime you
/// need a slice that is stored in the BPF interpreter's virtual address space. Because this source
/// code can be compiled with addresses of different bit depths, we cannot assume that the 64-bit
/// BPF interpreter's pointer sizes can be mapped to physical pointer sizes (`usize`, `*const u8`,
/// etc.)
///
/// In particular, if you need a slice-of-slices in the virtual space, the inner slices will
/// be different sizes in a 32-bit app build than in the 64-bit virtual space. Therefore instead of
/// a slice-of-slices, you should implement a slice-of-VmSlices, which can then use
/// [`VmSlice::translate`] to map to the physical address.
