#![allow(rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links)]
//! The task (transaction) scheduling code for the unified scheduler
//!
//! ### High-level API and design
//!
//! The most important type is [`SchedulingStateMachine`]. It takes new tasks (= transactions) and
//! may return back them if runnable via
//! [`::schedule_task()`](SchedulingStateMachine::schedule_task) while maintaining the account
//! readonly/writable lock rules. Those returned runnable tasks are guaranteed to be safe to
//! execute in parallel. Lastly, `SchedulingStateMachine` should be notified about the completion
//! of the execution via [`::deschedule_task()`](SchedulingStateMachine::deschedule_task), so that
//! conflicting tasks can be returned from
//! [`::schedule_next_unblocked_task()`](SchedulingStateMachine::schedule_next_unblocked_task) as
//! newly-unblocked runnable ones.
//!
//! The design principle of this crate (`solana-unified-scheduler-logic`) is simplicity for the
//! separation of concern. It is interacted only with a few of its public API by
//! `solana-unified-scheduler-pool`. This crate doesn't know about banks, slots, solana-runtime,
//! threads, crossbeam-channel at all. Because of this, it's deterministic, easy-to-unit-test, and
//! its perf footprint is well understood. It really focuses on its single job: sorting
//! transactions in executable order.
//!
//! ### Algorithm
//!
//! The algorithm can be said it's based on per-address FIFO queues, which are updated every time
//! both new task is coming (= called _scheduling_) and runnable (= _post-scheduling_) task is
//! finished (= called _descheduling_).
//!
//! For the _non-conflicting scheduling_ case, the story is very simple; it just remembers that all
//! of accessed addresses are write-locked or read-locked with the number of active (=
//! _currently-scheduled-and-not-descheduled-yet_) tasks. Correspondingly, descheduling does the
//! opposite book-keeping process, regardless whether a finished task has been conflicted or not.
//!
//! For the _conflicting scheduling_ case, it remembers that each of **non-conflicting addresses**
//! like the non-conflicting case above. As for **conflicting addresses**, each task is recorded to
//! respective FIFO queues attached to the (conflicting) addresses. Importantly, the number of
//! conflicting addresses of the conflicting task is also remembered.
//!
//! The last missing piece is that the scheduler actually tries to reschedule previously blocked
//! tasks while deschduling, in addition to the above-mentioned book-keeping processing. Namely,
//! when given address is ready for new fresh locking resulted from descheduling a task (i.e. write
//! lock is released or read lock count has reached zero), it pops out the first element of the
//! FIFO blocked-task queue of the address. Then, it immediately marks the address as relocked. It
//! also decrements the number of conflicting addresses of the popped-out task. As the final step,
//! if the number reaches to the zero, it means the task has fully finished locking all of its
//! addresses and is directly routed to be runnable. Lastly, if the next first element of the
//! blocked-task queue is trying to read-lock the address like the popped-out one, this
//! rescheduling is repeated as an optimization to increase parallelism of task execution.
//!
//! Put differently, this algorithm tries to gradually lock all of addresses of tasks at different
//! timings while not deviating the execution order from the original task ingestion order. This
//! implies there's no locking retries in general, which is the primary source of non-linear perf.
//! degradation.
//!
//! As a ballpark number from a synthesized micro benchmark on usual CPU for `mainnet-beta`
//! validators, it takes roughly 100ns to schedule and deschedule a transaction with 10 accounts.
//! And 1us for a transaction with 100 accounts. Note that this excludes crossbeam communication
//! overhead at all. That's said, it's not unrealistic to say the whole unified scheduler can
//! attain 100k-1m tps overall, assuming those transaction executions aren't bottlenecked.
//!
//! ### Runtime performance characteristics and data structure arrangement
//!
//! Its algorithm is very fast for high throughput, real-time for low latency. The whole
//! unified-scheduler architecture is designed from grounds up to support the fastest execution of
//! this scheduling code. For that end, unified scheduler pre-loads address-specific locking state
//! data structures (called [`UsageQueue`]) for all of transaction's accounts, in order to offload
//! the job to other threads from the scheduler thread. This preloading is done inside
//! [`create_task()`](SchedulingStateMachine::create_task). In this way, task scheduling
//! computational complexity is basically reduced to several word-sized loads and stores in the
//! schduler thread (i.e.  constant; no allocations nor syscalls), while being proportional to the
//! number of addresses in a given transaction. Note that this statement is held true, regardless
//! of conflicts. This is because the preloading also pre-allocates some scratch-pad area
//! ([`blocked_usages_from_tasks`](UsageQueueInner::blocked_usages_from_tasks)) to stash blocked
//! ones. So, a conflict only incurs some additional fixed number of mem stores, within error
//! margin of the constant complexity. And additional memory allocation for the scratchpad could
//! said to be amortized, if such an unusual event should occur.
//!
//! [`Arc`] is used to implement this preloading mechanism, because `UsageQueue`s are shared across
//! tasks accessing the same account, and among threads due to the preloading. Also, interior
//! mutability is needed. However, `SchedulingStateMachine` doesn't use conventional locks like
//! RwLock.  Leveraging the fact it's the only state-mutating exclusive thread, it instead uses
//! `UnsafeCell`, which is sugar-coated by a tailored wrapper called [`TokenCell`]. `TokenCell`
//! imposes an overly restrictive aliasing rule via rust type system to maintain the memory safety.
//! By localizing any synchronization to the message passing, the scheduling code itself attains
//! maximally possible single-threaed execution without stalling cpu pipelines at all, only
//! constrained to mem access latency, while efficiently utilizing L1-L3 cpu cache with full of
//! `UsageQueue`s.
//!
//! ### Buffer bloat insignificance
//!
//! The scheduler code itself doesn't care about the buffer bloat problem, which can occur in
//! unified scheduler, where a run of heavily linearized and blocked tasks could be severely
//! hampered by very large number of interleaved runnable tasks along side.  The reason is again
//! for separation of concerns. This is acceptable because the scheduling code itself isn't
//! susceptible to the buffer bloat problem by itself as explained by the description and validated
//! by the mentioned benchmark above. Thus, this should be solved elsewhere, specifically at the
//! scheduler pool.
